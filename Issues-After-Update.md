# Windows OS - Fixing Frequent Shutdowns and Reboots Guide

**Cause:** updating the windows OS can fix old bugs but it can also cause new bugs

**Fix:**
1. Right click the start button and open Device Manager
2. Locate the suspect device (adapters, display, etc.)
3. Double Click to open Properties and check for errors codes
4. Use the Roll Back Driver option if the issue started after a recent update

**What I learned:** 
One of the alternatives when you are dealing with frequent shutdowns and reboots is to copy the code from the device you suspect is causing the issues and browse it in the microsoft database.
Hope this helps you If you are facing shutdown issues with your windows OS.
